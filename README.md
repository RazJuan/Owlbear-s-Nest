## Owlbear's Nest

### An Open Source Dungeons and Dragons Character Sheet Creator
---
\
Owlbear's nest will be a desktop character creator for Dungeons and Dragons.\

I will be using this readme file as a way to document the progress of this project, it will be very rambly and disordered. 

I am looking at this project as a way to learn how to code in python and start understanding how to use object oriented programming using python. \
The full scope of the project is:
1. Create a character
2. Output PDF
3. Support the addition of expansions
4. Support the addition of homebrew content
4. Roll dice
5. Stop smoking crack

## Creating characters
To create a character, user inputted values based on dice rolls or points will need to be added to predetrmined fields such as: Health, Strength, Dexterity etc. \
As well as predetermined values such as: Race, Class and Alignment

Different races and classes will have different stat modifiers that will need to be added to the overall stats. Difference races and classes are proficient in different stats. 

After the character has been created, calculate the stat modifiers and add up proficiency bonus


## Output to PDF
2nd Hardest part of the project.

## Support the addition of expansions
Probably the most difficult part, I will leave this until last because I have no idea where to start

## Support the addition of homebrew content

I believe that this won't be too hard. Allow the user to create their own custom race/class and give them control of the modifiers, save the homebrew content to a file then add it to the list of predetrmined classes

## Roll dice
Probably the easiest thing to do. Give the user the option to roll a dice, pick a random number between 1 and 20, or whatever die value they have picked then output that value. 

## Stop smoking crack
Impossible
